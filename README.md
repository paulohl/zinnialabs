## Summary: Visual + Content Layout Plan for zinnialabs.science

🌐 1. **Identity and Core Message**

**Name**: Zinnia Labs
**Domain**: 
```
https://zinnialabs.science
```
**Tagline** (early draft):

> "Where AI meets scientific rigor, not market noise."

**Positioning**:

- The **research division** of Zinnia Holdings.
- A home for **advanced AI thought**, not just product demos.
- Focused on: AI philosophy, LLM internals, diffusion models, zero-persistence

🧱 2. **Site Structure**: Minimal Sections, Maximum Impact

[I]. **Home / Lab Entry**
   - **Hero block**:
       - Clean white or jet-black background (toggle optional).
       - Thin black outlined logo or glyph.
       - One-line manifesto, like:
     >

      > “Zinnia Labs is an AI research node exploring what lies beyond pattern recognition.”
       - Optional glitch/oscilloscope line motif pulsing quietly.
   - Animated lead-in:
       - Scrolling quote in monospaced text (e.g., Clarke, Turing, Lovelace).
       - Fade-in transition like command line:
     >
     
     >_ Initializing: Agentic AI Labs_

[II]. **Research Areas**
   - Layout: **Three horizontal bands**, minimal cards or typewriter text.
   - Titles only at first — expands/clicks reveal more (accordion or hover).
       - **AI & Philosophy**
       - **Agentic Architectures**
       - **Latent Indexing & LLM Internals**
       - **Zero-State Deployment**
       - **Synthetic Threat Simulation**
       - **Reinforcement Learning & Decision Theory**

[III]. **Projects / Artifacts**
    - Blog-style or grid of published:
        - Research articles (hosted PDF, Authorea, or preprint links).
        - Book chapters.
        - AI security illustrations and pipeline diagrams.
        - Open-source repos (linked to GitHub).
    - Each card: black border, light hover effect, metadata (date, author, repo

[IV]. The Lab Manifesto
    - Tone: Half-academic, half-cyberpunk.
    - Expresses:
        - Independence from VC-driven hype.
        - A love for systems thinking and real-world impact.
        - Commitment to rigorous, post-PhD-level experimentation.

Sample section:

> “We believe in engineering truths, not frameworks built for investor decks. This Lab exists to slow down thinking, to give ideas enough space to mature, and to bring forth AI systems with architectural integrity.”

5. Contact / Collaboration
    - Just an email or mailto: link with instructions like:
    >
    
    > “If you’re a publisher, researcher, or builder looking to think deeper — contact us. If you’re raising money, we probably won’t reply.”

🎨 3. Visual Language and Style

Palette:

Pure white #ffffff and black #000000.

Accent: screaming red #ff0033, radioactive green #00ff99, or blueprint cyan #33ccff — used sparingly.

Typography:

Headers: Giorgio, Monument Grotesk, or League Spartan.

Body: IBM Plex Mono, Inter, or Cormorant Garamond.

Layout:

1-column design, wide margins, extreme white space.
Layout:

1-column design, wide margins, extreme white space.

Everything floats or is hard-aligned to a grid.

Line dividers like old schematics or Bauhaus sketches.
